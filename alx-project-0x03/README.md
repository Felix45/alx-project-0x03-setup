## Basics of NextJS
**Pages:** Files in the /pages directory automatically become routes.

 - /pages/index.tsx → /

 - /pages/about.tsx → /about

**Components:** Reusable UI pieces, typically stored in /components.

**Routing:** Built-in file-based routing system — no need for react-router.

**Styling:** Supports CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, Sass, and more.

**Static Assets:** Place images or files in the /public folder and access via /filename.

**API Routes:** Create backend functions in /pages/api/*.js.

**Pre-rendering:** Pages can be server-side rendered (SSR) or statically generated (SSG).
